NEw cool things that I learned:
<option>tag and "selected" attribute

in CSS: 
".class1:hover .class2" this will control the styling of "class2" when "class1" is hovered --> cool!
use opacity to control the show/off feature


navigtor.userAgent : NOT a reliable way for browser detection
==> SHOULD : Check the browser specific feature (document on MDN for more detail)
